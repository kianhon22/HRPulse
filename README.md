# HRPulse - Integrated Employee Productivity & Engagement System (Mobile App for Employees)
HRPulse is a comprehensive HR and employee system that addresses the limitations of traditional HR processes in modern work environments. The system consolidates four essential modules, Attendance and Leave Management, Survey and Feedback, Recognition and Rewards, and Reporting and Analytics into a single and user-friendly platform accessible via mobile app for employees and web portal for HR. It aims to create a more efficient, transparent and employee centric approach to HR management in order to enhance employee engagement and productivity, along with the utilization of sentiment analysis and AI recommendation features.
